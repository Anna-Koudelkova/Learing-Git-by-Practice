# Learing-Git-by-Practice

Repository made and cloned **to learn git basics** and to see what *problems/challenges* might occur while linking Git with Github.

The script is just a quick draft to calculate when it is safe to drive after beer consumption in Czechia using [Widmark](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Widmark) equation. 
It was used purely for the purposes of not having an empty repository.
